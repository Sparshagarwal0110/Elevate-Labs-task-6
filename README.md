## 🔐 Passwords Created & Evaluated

| Password              | Complexity Level | Score (PasswordMeter) | Feedback Summary                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `password123`         | Weak             | 25%                    | Too common, lacks symbols, easy to guess          |
| `Passw0rd!`           | Medium           | 55%                    | Better—uses symbol and number, but still guessable|
| `S@feC0de2025`        | Strong           | 78%                    | Good mix of chars, numbers, symbol, decent length |
| `tR7$Wq!v9xZ&uF#4`    | Very Strong      | 100%                   | High entropy, random, complex, ideal password     |

## 📌 Tips Learned for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Include a mix of uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (e.g., `@`, `!`, `#`, `$`).
- Avoid common words (e.g., `password`, `123456`, `qwerty`).
- Don’t reuse old passwords.
- Use a password manager to store complex passwords.

## 🛡️ Common Password Attack Methods

| Attack Type       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force       | Tries all possible combinations until it finds the right one.               |
| Dictionary Attack | Uses a list of commonly used passwords and words to guess the password.     |
| Phishing          | Tricks the user into revealing their password (via fake websites or emails).|

## 🔍 How Password Complexity Improves Security

- Longer passwords increase the number of possible combinations exponentially.
- Symbols and mixed case add more variations than just lowercase letters.
- Random passwords are harder to guess than ones with patterns or dictionary words.
- A strong password takes years to crack with brute force, whereas a weak one can be cracked in seconds.
